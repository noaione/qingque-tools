However, due to reasons in the real world, she had no choice but to abdicate the throne to me, having me fulfill her unrealized ambitions.\\nThe Tizocic Dynasty will bear witness over generations, passing down its legacy, and continue to watch over its people until the end of time. If there are urgent matters that require help, please do not bear it alone, and contact me.\\nAlso: To facilitate my subjects who have been unable to enter their dreams due to various circumstances, I will establish an administrative office at The Reverie Hotel in the real world. If there are important matters to discuss, please leave your dream and seek me out.\\nSecond Emperor of the Tizocic Dynasty, Tizocic III",
